# IJCMWANZA Court Voice Translator

A voice translator application that converts spoken language to text, translates the text to a desired language, and then plays the translated text using text-to-speech. This project uses Python's `speech_recognition` for voice recognition, `translate` for text translation, `gTTS` for text-to-speech, and `pygame` for audio playback. The graphical interface is handled by `tkinter`.

## Features

- Recognizes spoken language and converts it to text.
- Translates text to a specified target language.
- Converts translated text to speech and plays it back.
- Allows users to choose source and target languages dynamically.
- Simple and interactive GUI for ease of use.
